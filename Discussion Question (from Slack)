@media (max-width: 600px) {
 .grid-container  {
   grid-template-areas:
     'header header header header header header'
     'left left left left left left'
     'middle middle middle middle middle middle'
     'right right right right right right'
     'footer footer footer footer footer footer';
 }
}
Here is the code which I wanted to understand further. Using the comments in the code from the website, 
I can figure out that this code is used to create the responsive layout of the page. However, 
looking at the actual code itself, I am struggling to understand how this actually creates this effect. 
What portions of the code actually create the movement of the columns when you changed the size of the window? 
This is an important portion to any website so I wanted to make sure I understood it in detail.
